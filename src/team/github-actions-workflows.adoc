# Workflows Documentation

## Train Builds

In dataflow related repos you may see workflows named as _worker_ and in `spring-cloud-dataflow`
workflows named as _controller_. These are _train_ builds where workflow dispatch is handled
via GitHub api's and this multi-repo _train_ build is orchestrated, you guessed it, within
_controller_ workflows.

Action code which handles this _train_ build is in https://github.com/jvalkeal/build-zoo-handler[build-zoo-handler]
and you can find more docs about it there. In a nutshell when _controller_ workflow is fired,
rules configuration in it makes a choice which remote repo workflow should be dispatched via
_workflow dispatch_ api. When _worker_ workflows completes it calls `home` and then _controller_
can make a choice what to do next. Within these ping-pong dispatches a `context` is kept alive and
this `context` contains arbitry information what any _worker_ can contribute into it.

Having this in-flight context is helpful when a _train_ release build is done as then _worker_
workflow can tell what was its released version and related other workflows in any other repos
can use this information to update project dependencies. Thus we're getting foundation
to orchestrate various things without that much manual intervention.

### Snapshot Train

This is a simple all repo _train_ which can be fired from `spring-cloud-dataflow` with workflow
`build-snapshot-controller`. It starts by instructing `spring-cloud-dataflow-build` to do its
things and ends up last step where `spring-cloud-dataflow` is build.
